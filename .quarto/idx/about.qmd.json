After taking my first econometrics course and excelling in both it and my capstone course, I realized how much I enjoyed data analysis. I ranked among the top students in those courses and was invited by the Head of the Economics Department to serve as a tutor. That experience ultimately led me to pursue my Master of Applied Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I am currently maintaining a 3.96 GPA and expect to graduate in June 2026\n\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section-block\">\n  <img src=\"images/stunna/prof.jpg\" alt=\"Professional photo\" class=\"section-photo\">\n  <h3>Experience</h3>\n  <p class=\"small\">\n  \nMy work experience has grown pretty naturally over time as I figured out what I enjoy and what I’m good at. I started out at Humble Sea Brewery, where I spent a few months learning how production actually works day to day. I helped keep materials moving, solved small operational problems, and got a feel for what it takes to keep a physical business running smoothly. They also had hundreds of types of beer they made so i'm always happy to talk about different drinks!\n\nStarting my Senior year, I became an Econometrics Tutor at UC Santa Cruz after doing really well in the coursework. Working with students and professors forced me to really understand the material, and it showed me that data analysis was something I wanted to keep pursuing. It also gave me the chance to teach which was something I didn't know I was good at. It was very rewarding helping my students be successful in a class I felt was so important.\n\nAt the end of my time in Santa Cruz, I moved into a Financial Assistant role at the Homeless Garden Project, which was my first real exposure to working with numbers in a meaningful way. I handled donation and event data, helped with budgeting, cleaned up old records, and realized I genuinely liked making messy information usable. It also was a chance to use my skillset to help an organzation that did so much good to the community. Here is a link to the [Homeless Garden Project](https://homelessgardenproject.org/) if you're interested.\n\n\nEverything came together when I joined North Pier Search Consulting. I originally came in as a Sales and Marketing Intern, but over time I took on more analytical and operational work. Now I help with research, R&D checks, CRM clean-ups, advisor analytics, social media strategy, case-study writing, and supporting active search engagements. It’s the role where I’ve grown the most, and it’s also where I started to see how my data skills could actually help solve real business problems. In Summer of 2025, I added another layer of experience at Econ One Research, where I worked on antitrust and class-action cases by cleaning large datasets, building Stata workflows, and reviewing evidence for litigation teams.\n\nAll of these roles built on each other: Humble Sea taught me structure, tutoring taught me how to communicate, Homeless Garden Project taught me how to apply data to real decisions, Econ One taught me how to work with large, complex datasets under tight deadlines, North Pier taught me what growing in a role feels like. Together, they tell the story of how I grew from general operations work into someone who loves using data to answer hard questions.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(120px, 1fr)); gap:24px; align-items:center; text-align:center; margin:28px 0;\">\n\n  <img src=\"images/stunna/hs.png\" alt=\"Humble Sea Brewery\" style=\"height:60px;\">\n  <img src=\"images/stunna/hs2.png\" alt=\"UC Santa Cruz\" style=\"height:60px;\">\n  <img src=\"images/stunna/ucsc3.jpeg\" alt=\"Homeless Garden Project\" style=\"height:60px;\">\n  <img src=\"images/stunna/e12.jpg\" alt=\"Econ One\" style=\"height:60px;\">\n  <img src=\"images/stunna/np2.png\" alt=\"North Pier Search Consulting\" style=\"height:60px;\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n:::: card\n<h3>Projects i’m working on right now</h3>\n\n<p class=\"small\">\n<strong>Arsenal analytics</strong>: scraping FBref, building match and player trackers, and testing simple forecasting ideas on xG and roles.
