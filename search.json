    "text": "Matheus (Taye) Grover\n\n\nMASDS @ UCLA · North Pier Search Consulting\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n✉️ Email 🔗 LinkedIn 💻 GitHub 𝕏 Profile 📄 Resume\n\n\nBest way to reach me is email.\n\n\n\n\nHi, I’m Matheus or Taye Grover\n\nI’m a second year in UCLA’s Masters in Statistics and Data Science. I also work as a Sales and Marketing Intern for North Pier Search Consulting where I’m slowly transitioning to a more data-focused role with them.\n\n\nThis website is a homepage for me to display my academics, projects, and hobbies I’m passionate about. I find it is a lot easier to learn concepts when you can apply them to things you love to do in your free time, so eventually Arsenal, Lego, Books will all have projects attached to them. This website will be constantly updated as I find better ways to show off my projects.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nI earned my Bachelor of Arts in Business Management Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in June 2024, graduating with a 3.74 GPA. After taking my first econometrics course and excelling in both it and my capstone course, I realized how much I enjoyed data analysis. I ranked among the top students in those courses and was invited by the Head of the Economics Department to serve as a tutor. That experience ultimately led me to pursue my Master of Applied Statistics and Data Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I am currently maintaining a 3.96 GPA and expect to graduate in June 2026\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\n\nMy work experience has grown pretty naturally over time as I figured out what I enjoy and what I’m good at. I started out at Humble Sea Brewery, where I spent a few months learning how production actually works day to day. I helped keep materials moving, solved small operational problems, and got a feel for what it takes to keep a physical business running smoothly. They also had hundreds of types of beer they made so i’m always happy to talk about different drinks!\nStarting my Senior year, I became an Econometrics Tutor at UC Santa Cruz after doing really well in the coursework. Working with students and professors forced me to really understand the material, and it showed me that data analysis was something I wanted to keep pursuing. It also gave me the chance to teach which was something I didn’t know I was good at. It was very rewarding helping my students be successful in a class I felt was so important.\nAt the end of my time in Santa Cruz, I moved into a Financial Assistant role at the Homeless Garden Project, which was my first real exposure to working with numbers in a meaningful way. I handled donation and event data, helped with budgeting, cleaned up old records, and realized I genuinely liked making messy information usable. It also was a chance to use my skillset to help an organzation that did so much good to the community. Here is a link to the Homeless Garden Project if you’re interested.\nEverything came together when I joined North Pier Search Consulting. I originally came in as a Sales and Marketing Intern, but over time I took on more analytical and operational work. Now I help with research, R&D checks, CRM clean-ups, advisor analytics, social media strategy, case-study writing, and supporting active search engagements. It’s the role where I’ve grown the most, and it’s also where I started to see how my data skills could actually help solve real business problems. In Summer of 2025, I added another layer of experience at Econ One Research, where I worked on antitrust and class-action cases by cleaning large datasets, building Stata workflows, and reviewing evidence for litigation teams.\nAll of these roles built on each other: Humble Sea taught me structure, tutoring taught me how to communicate, Homeless Garden Project taught me how to apply data to real decisions, Econ One taught me how to work with large, complex datasets under tight deadlines, North Pier taught me what growing in a role feels like. Together, they tell the story of how I grew from general operations work into someone who loves using data to answer hard questions.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nProjects i’m working on right now\n\n\nArsenal analytics: scraping FBref, building match and player trackers, and testing simple forecasting ideas on xG and roles. Eventually I want to combine this with my thesis and be able to out-predict gambling player props. Right now I’m in the data collection phase for my thesis. I need data from 25 teams and over 20 players per team. Twice now data scrapers I’ve built have been patched which has slowed the process.  Marketing analytics: building a structure for marketing analytics at North Pier. I want to increase our social media presence and in order to do that I need to know what works and what doesn’t  Cash Balance project: classified work project cleaning 5500 outputs for cash balance plan returns and basic validation checks.  LEGO price prediction project: focusing on a sub-theme like Star Wars or Batman. I want to understand what drives the after-market value."
